Bubble of two
=============

Consider a World composed of exactly:

* two subjects, John and Paul
* 200$
* a rock

Each subject is given 100$, and each subject is certain he can sell the rock for more than the amount it costed.
The rock is given arbitrarily to one of the subjects, lets say Paul. What will it happen?

Rationally, not having any other goals and both subjects being human, they will try to maximize the amount of money they possess.
Paul, with the rock, will sell it to John for a reasonable price, for instance 5$, which is more than it costed, nothing.
John will then sell it back to Paul for 10$.

Let us stop for a second and analyze the economics of the situation. The World initially was composed of two subjects, 200$ and a worthless rock.
John bough the rock for 5$ and sold it for 10$, he made 5$ and now possesses 105$. John has made a good deal so far.
Paul, on the other hand, first sold the rock for 5$ and then bought it back for 10$, which means he now has less money, 95$. However, his illiquid assets, that is the rock, are appraised at, at least 10$, meaning that his combined assets, liquid and illiquid, total over 105$. So the World is now composed of 200$ and a rock valued at over 10$.

The total World economy growth for the last three paragraphs was 5%.
