Freedom |  | Merit

I was born in a free country. Even thou this might seem very usual and uninteresting, it has come to mold my view of the world and of its future.
The truth is, not only was I born in a free country, but I also grew up in a time of hope, wealth and happiness.

I was born in 1985, a mere two months away before Portugal joined the European Union. The last great economical crisis of the century was then left behind and the FMI was about to leave the country. I couldn't remember that time, but my beliefe is that people were happy and and would live through their dificulties, certain of a brighter future.

Although I can't be sure of the climate in 1980, the 90's are the years of my concious youth. These were years of great hope, not in Portugal, but all over the world. Or, at least, the western world. I remeber, these were my actual thoughts, feeling how cientists would certainly find the cure for cancer and AIDS, how they would even reverse old age. The 90's was a decade of freedom, hope and happiness.
